/*Variables are containers for storing data values.

In C#, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
bool - stores values with two states: true or false*/

int myNum = 5;
Console.WriteLine(myNum);
Console.ReadLine();
double myDoubleNum = 5.99D;
char myLetter = 'D';
bool myBool = true;
string myText = "Hello";






//This will declare the variable as "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only:

const int myNums = 15;
myNum = 20; // error

string firstName = "John ";
string lastName = "Doe";
string fullName = firstName + lastName;
Console.WriteLine(fullName);
//To declare more than one variable of the same type, use a comma-separated list:
int x = 5, y = 6, z = 50;
Console.WriteLine(x + y + z);
int a, b, c;
x = y = z = 50;
Console.WriteLine(x + y + z);






Console.WriteLine();
